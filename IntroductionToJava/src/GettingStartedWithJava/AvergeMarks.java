//Problem statement
//Write a program to input a name(as a single character) and marks of three tests as m1, m2, and m3 
//of a student considering all the three marks have been given in integer format.
//
//Now, you need to calculate the average of the given marks and print it along with the 
//name as mentioned in the output format section.
//
//All the test marks are in integers and hence calculate the average in integer as well. 
//That is, you need to print the integer part of the average only and neglect the decimal part.
