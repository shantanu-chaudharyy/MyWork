//Problem statement
//You are given two numbers, ‘X’ and ‘Y’. Your task is to find the greatest common divisor of the given two numbers.
//
//The Greatest Common Divisor of any two integers is the largest number that divides both integers.
//
//For Example:
//You are given ‘X’ as 20 and ‘Y’ as 15. The greatest common divisor, which divides both 15 and 20, is 5. Hence the answer is 5.

		int t = sr.nextInt();

			int Num1 = sr.nextInt();
			int Num2 = sr.nextInt();
			while (Num2 != 0) {
				Temp = Num2;
				Num2 = Num1 % Num2;
				Num1 = Temp;
			}
			GCD = Num1;
			System.out.println(GCD);
