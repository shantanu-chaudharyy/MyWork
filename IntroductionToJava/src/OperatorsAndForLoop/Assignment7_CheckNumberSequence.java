//Problem statement
//You are given S, a sequence of n integers i.e. S = s1, s2, ..., sn. 
//Compute if it is possible to split S into two parts 
//: s1, s2, ..., si and si+1, si+2, ….., sn (0 <= i <= n) 
//in such a way that the first part is strictly decreasing while the second is strictly increasing one.
//
//Note : We say that x is strictly larger than y when x > y. 
//So, a strictly increasing sequence can be 1 4 8. However, 1 4 4 is NOT a strictly increasing sequence.
//
//
//That is, in the sequence if numbers are decreasing, they can start increasing at one point. Thereafter, they cannot decrease at any point further.
//
//Sequence made up of only increasing numbers or only decreasing numbers is a valid sequence. 
//So, in both the cases, print true.
//
//You just need to print true/false. No need to split the sequence.
