//we need binary to number
//
//1.) we will take a input as binary i.e 1,0.
//2.) then we will take a integer name pv ( place value will increase by twice in every iteration) 
//3.) then we will initiate a loop which will rum till answer is not 0 (N not equal to zero)
//4.) then we will take out the last digit by using modulous funtion i.e (N%10).
//5.) after geting last digit we will have our answer by using formula (answer = pv*lastdigit)
//6.)then we will divide the input 'N' by 10 so that we can get next last digit by doing modulous of 10.
//7.)we will increace pv by 2 time in every iteration.
//8.) then we will come out of loop then give our print statement as syso(answer)
